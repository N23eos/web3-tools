Hereâ€™s a sample **README.md** file description for your repository explaining the purpose and usage of the scripts.

# Wallet Pattern Finder Scripts

This repository contains a set of Python scripts to assist in generating cryptocurrency wallets and finding wallets that match specific hexadecimal patterns. It is designed for developers and crypto enthusiasts looking to explore wallet creation based on custom patterns.

---

## Scripts Overview

### 1. `wallets-creator.py`
This script generates new cryptocurrency wallets. It can be used as the base for bulk wallet creation.

#### How to Use:
- Run the script to generate random wallets (public/private key pairs).
- The output will display wallet addresses and their corresponding private keys.

---

### 2. `wallet-pattern-creator.py`
This script generates wallets and compares their addresses to predefined patterns. Use this script if you're looking for wallet addresses that match specific patterns.

#### How to Use:
1. Edit the script to add or customize the `PATTERNS` list with the desired hexadecimal patterns (e.g., `"0xABCDEF"`, `"0x1234"`).
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python wallet-pattern-creator.py
   ```
3. The script will generate wallets until one of the patterns is matched. The matching wallet's address and private key will be displayed.

---

### 3. `wallets-pattern-until-find-anywhere.py`
This script continues generating wallets until it finds an address that contains the pattern **anywhere** in the address string.

#### How to Use:
1. Define the patterns in the `PATTERNS` list.
2. Execute the script:
   ```bash
   python wallets-pattern-until-find-anywhere.py
   ```
3. The script will print the address and private key when a pattern is matched.

---

### 4. `wallets-pattern-until-find-beginning.py`
This script specifically looks for wallet addresses where the pattern is matched **at the beginning** of the address.

#### How to Use:
1. Update the `PATTERNS` list with your desired starting patterns.
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python wallets-pattern-until-find-beginning.py
   ```
3. The script will stop and print the matching wallet once the pattern is found.

---

## Requirements
To use these scripts, you need Python 3 installed along with the `web3` library. Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Customizing Patterns
1. Open any script and locate the `PATTERNS` list.
2. Add your desired hexadecimal patterns (e.g., `"0x0000"`, `"0x1234"`).
3. Save the file and execute the script to start generating wallets.

---

## Notes
- **Performance**: The scripts may take time to find a matching wallet depending on the complexity of the patterns.
- **Security**: Always handle private keys securely and avoid exposing them to third parties.
